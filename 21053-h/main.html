<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> book is designed to accompany
an introductory study of the history of German literature. It is assumed
that the history itself will be learned, so far as necessary, either
from lectures or from some other book devoted to the subject. As the
selections were made, for the most part, while I was writing my own
short history of German literature for the series published under the
general editorship of Mr. Edmund Gosse and known as “Literatures of the
World,” it was natural that the Anthology should take on, to some
extent, the character of a companion book to the History. At the same
time I did not desire that either book should necessarily involve the
use of the other. Hence the absence of cross references; and hence also,
in the Anthology, the brief introductory notes, giving important dates
and summary characterizations. These are meant to enable the student to
read the selections intelligently without constant recourse to some
other book.</p>

<p>In preparing Part First, I have had in mind the student who has
learned to read the language of Goethe and Schiller with some facility,
and would like to know something of the earlier periods, but has not
studied, and may not care to study, Old and Middle German. On this
account the selections are given in modern German translations. The
original texts are omitted because space was very precious, and because
the book was intended as an aid to literary rather than linguistic
study. In making the selections, my first principle was to give a good
deal of the best rather than a little of everything. I&nbsp;wished to
make friends for medieval German poetry, and it seemed to me that this
could best be done by showing it in its strength and its beauty. So I
have ignored much that might have had a historical or linguistic
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
<a name = "pageiv" id = "pageiv"> </a>
interest for the scholar, and have steadily applied the criterion of
literary worth.</p>

<p>My second principle was to give preference to that which is truly
German, in contradistinction from that which is Latin, or European, or
merely Christian. The Latinists of every epoch are in general
disregarded, as not being of German literature in the strict sense; yet
I have devoted eight pages to <i>Waltharius</i> and three to
<i>Rudlieb</i>, on the ground that the matter of these poems is
essentially German, albeit their form is Latin. On the other hand,
Hrotswith is not represented at all, because, while an interesting
personage in her way, she belongs to German literature neither by her
form nor by her matter. The religious poetry of the twelfth century
receives rather scant attention, partly because it is mostly pretty poor
stuff&mdash;there is not much else like the beautiful Arnstein hymn to
the Virgin, No. XIII&mdash;and partly because it embodies ideas and
feelings that belonged to medieval Christianity everywhere.</p>

<p>For each selection I have given the best translation that I could
find, and where nothing satisfactory could be found in print I have made
a translation myself. Where nothing is said as to the authorship of a
translation, it is to be understood as my own. In this part of my work I
have tried to preserve the form and savor of the originals, and at the
same time to keep as close to the exact sense as the constraints of rime
and meter would allow. In Nos. XI to XVII a somewhat perplexing problem
was presented. The originals frequently have assonance instead of rime
and the verse is sometimes crude in other ways. An attempt to imitate
the assonances and crudities in modern German would simply have given
the effect of bad verse-making. On the other hand, to translate into
smooth tetrameters, with perfect rime everywhere, would have given an
illusory appearance of regularity and have made the translation <i>zu
schön</i>. (I&nbsp;fear that No. VII, the selections from Otfried, for
the translation of which I am not responsible, is open to this charge.)
So I adopted the expedient of a line-for-line prose version, dropping
into rime only where the modern equivalent of the Middle German took the
form of rime naturally. After regular rime becomes
established&mdash;with Heinrich von Veldeke&mdash;I&nbsp;have employed
it in all my translations. For my shortcomings as a German versifier I
hope to be regarded with a measure of indulgence. The question of
inclusion or exclusion could not be made to turn on the
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
<a name = "pagev" id = "pagev"> </a>
preëxistence of a good translation, because too much that is important
and interesting would have had to be omitted. I&nbsp;should have been
glad to take the advice of Mephisto,</p>

<p class = "verse">
Associiert euch mit einem Poeten,</p>

<p>but I was unable to effect a partnership of that kind.</p>

<p>Beginning with No. XL, the selections are given in their original
form without modernization. While Part Second, no less than Part First,
looks to literary rather than linguistic study, it seemed to me very
desirable that the selections from writers of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries should represent the literary language of that
time. By modernizing I could have dispensed with many a footnote and
have made the texts somewhat easier to read; but that gain would have
entailed a very unfortunate loss of savor, and have deprived the
selections of all incidental value as <i>Sprachproben</i>. On the other
hand, I&nbsp;could see no advantage in a scrupulous reproduction of
careless punctuation, mere mistakes, or meaningless peculiarities of
spelling. As there is no logical stopping-place when an editor once
begins to retouch a text, I&nbsp;finally decided to follow, in each
selection, either a trustworthy reprint or else a good critical edition,
without attempting to harmonize the different editors or to apply any
general rules of my own. The reader is thus assured of a fairly
authentic text, though he will find inconsistencies of spelling due to
the idiosyncrasy of editors. Thus one editor may preserve <i>vnd</i> or
<i>vnnd</i>, while another prints <i>und</i>; one may have <i>itzt</i>,
another <i>jtzt</i>, and so&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>Finally, I&nbsp;desire to call attention here to the fact that, while
a few selections from Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller are given, by way of
illustrating their early work in its relation to the literary
renascence, no attempt is made to deal adequately with the classical
literature of the eighteenth century. The book extends <i>to</i> the
classics. I&nbsp;must admit that the limit thus set is a little vague,
and from a theoretical point of view not quite satisfactory; but
practical considerations decided in favor of it. To have done justice to
the classics, on the scale adopted for the rest of the book, would have
required an additional hundred pages, devoted to long extracts from
works which, for the most part, have been carefully edited for American
students, are commonly read in schools and colleges, and could be
presumed to be familiar to most users of the Anthology. As the
additional matter
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
<a name = "pagevi" id = "pagevi"> </a>
would thus have been largely useless, it seemed to me that the ideal
gain in symmetry would be more than offset by the increased bulk and
cost of the book, which was already large enough. I&nbsp;hold of course
that anthologies have their use in the study of literary history; but it
would be a mistake, in my judgment, for any student to take up a volume
of selections without having first read the more important works of
Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller.</p>
